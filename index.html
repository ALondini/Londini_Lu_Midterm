    <h4 class="center">Ebooks (Pros)</h4>
    <p>
      Ebooks and ereaders are very versatile and are great for carrying around
      as they are portable and lightweight and can be used anywhere while not
      needing to carry a bunch of books that are very heavy and bulky with you.
      They can carry thousands of ebooks on a single device, without worrying
      about storage, as well as being very compact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ebooks are much cheaper than physical books because they don’t need to be
      printed out, bound together, packaged, or shipped anywhere. They also save
      a lot of paper s paper is not needed at all, and digitizing the materials
      is much cheaper then publishing them. Ebooks also don’t take up space on
      the bookshelf as they are stored online or on the ereader.

    <h4 class="center">Physical Books (Cons)</h4>
    <p>
      Many people like to read books on the road, especially while traveling,
      but at the same time, physical books not only take up space in your
      luggage but are also very heavy. While it is fun to always have a book
      with you, physical books can be annoying to carry around as even one book
      can be heavy to carry around with you especially if you have other stuff
      that you need, such as notebooks and other stuff for classes, or other
      outings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Physical books are much more expensive than ebooks for a number of
      reasons, like printing cose, supply and demand. Especially like hardcover
      books, which are much more expensive because they are of better quality.
      While ebooks are all digital and do not use paper or made physical.
