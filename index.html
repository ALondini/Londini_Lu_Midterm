    <h4 class = "center">Physical Books (Pros)</h4>
    <p>
      With physical books you never need to be able to access the internet or
      download any books as they are all printed out on paper and don’t even
      have a way to access the internet. Physical books are great when you are
      on the road with no way to access the internet, and they will never die on
      you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading physical books doesn't strain your eyes like ebooks do by looking
      at a screen the entire time you are reading. Staring at a screen for hours
      at a time is never good for your eyes, especially if you love to read and
      spend the majority of your time reading. Physical books are also great if
      you are trying to give your eyes a break from staring at screens all day.
    </p>

    <h4 class = "center">Ebooks (Cons)</h4>
    <p>
      In order for ebooks to work, they need to be connected to the internet in
      order to do just about everything: sign-in, browse, shop and download the
      new content to your device. Without the internet to perform these steps,
      the device will be basically useless. Too bad if you are trying to read on
      the road, at the beach, or camping in the mountains, without the internet
      to be able to access your books!

      Reading on ereaders or tablets requires staring at the screen for long
      periods of time, which can cause symptoms like dry eyes, headaches and
      blurred vision, leading to more discomfort while reading. For those who
      take advantage of the benefits of ebooks to read at night, their eyes get
      tired more quickly.

    <h4 class = "center">Ebooks (Pros)</h4>
    <p>
      Ebooks and ereaders are very versatile and are great for carrying around
      as they are portable and lightweight and can be used anywhere while not
      needing to carry a bunch of books that are very heavy and bulky with you.
      They can carry thousands of ebooks on a single device, without worrying
      about storage, as well as being very compact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ebooks are much cheaper than physical books because they don’t need to be
      printed out, bound together, packaged, or shipped anywhere. They also save
      a lot of paper s paper is not needed at all, and digitizing the materials
      is much cheaper then publishing them. Ebooks also don’t take up space on
      the bookshelf as they are stored online or on the ereader.

    <h4 class = "center">Physical Books (Cons)</h4>
    <p>
      Many people like to read books on the road, especially while traveling,
      but at the same time, physical books not only take up space in your
      luggage but are also very heavy. While it is fun to always have a book
      with you, physical books can be annoying to carry around as even one book
      can be heavy to carry around with you especially if you have other stuff
      that you need, such as notebooks and other stuff for classes, or other
      outings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Physical books are much more expensive than ebooks for a number of
      reasons, like printing cose, supply and demand. Especially like hardcover
      books, which are much more expensive because they are of better quality.
      While ebooks are all digital and do not use paper or made physical.
